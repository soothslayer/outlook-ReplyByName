===================

Outlook VBA script that replies to emails using the Sender's name

You can simply paste this code into The Visual Basic Editor within Outlook.

If you want you then can follow the instructions at the link below to add the vba scripts to the toolbar:

I went a step further on my Outlook and replaced the Reply and Reply All buttons with shortcuts to the VBA scripts (I changed the name and the icen so that they look identical to the normal Reply and Reply All buttons). Then I used a third party macro program to activate the VBA scripts when I pressed Ctrl + R and Ctrl + Shift + R respectively).
